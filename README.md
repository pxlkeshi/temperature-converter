# Temperature Converter

This is a simple JavaScript program that converts a temperature from **Kelvin** to **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Newton**.

## How It Works
- Starts with a Kelvin temperature
- Converts it to Celsius
- Then calculates the Fahrenheit and Newton equivalents
- Results are rounded down and logged to the console

Great for practicing basic math, variables, and console output in JavaScript!
